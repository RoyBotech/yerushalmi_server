# Node.js MongoDB Server with JWT Authentication

This project implements a simple Node.js server using Express.js that interacts with a MongoDB database. It features JWT-based authentication to secure endpoints and allows users to search and sort data via API requests.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication:** Secure API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Use Mongoose to manage data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Search and Sort Capabilities:** Dynamically query data based on search terms and sort parameters provided via API requests.
